## Project requirements

### 1 - All your endpoints must be REST standard

- Use the appropriate HTTP verbs for each operation.

- Group and standardize your URLs on each resource.

- Ensure that your endpoints always return a response, whether the operations are successful or not.

- Return correct status codes (resource created, validation error, authorization, etc).

### 2 - Create an endpoint for product registration

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/products`);

- Submitted products must be saved in a **collection** of MongoDB;

- The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "product_name",
  "quantity": "product_quantity"
}
```

- `name` must be a _string_ longer than 5 characters and must be unique;

- `quantity` must be an integer greater than 0;

- Each product must have an id that is unique and generated at the time the resource is created. You can use the ID generated by MongoDB

- The endpoint response in case of success must be the created product.

### 3 - Create an endpoint to list the products

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/products`) or (`/products/:id`);

- Through the `/products` path, all products must be returned;

- Through the `/products/:id` path, only the product with the `id` present in the URL must be returned;

### 4 - Create an endpoint to delete a product

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/products/:id`);

- Only the product with the `id` present in the URL should be deleted;

### 5 - Create an endpoint to update a product

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/products/:id`);

- The request body must follow the same structure as the method responsible for adding a product;

- Only the product with the `id` present in the URL must be updated;

### 6 - Create an endpoint to register sales

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/sales`);

- Sent sales must be saved in a MongoDB `collection`;

- It must be possible to register the sale of several products through the same request;

- The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
[
  {
  "productId": "product_id",
  "quantity": "product_quantity"
  }
  ...
]
```

- The `productId` must be the same as the `id` of a previously registered product;

- `quantity` must be an integer greater than 0;

- Each sale must have an id that is unique and generated at the time the resource is created;

- The endpoint response in case of success must be the created sale(s).

### 7 - Create an endpoint to list sales

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/sales`) or (`/sales/:id`);

- Through the `/sales` path, all sales must be returned;

- Through the `/sales/:id` path, only the sale with the `id` present in the URL must be returned;

### 8 - Create an endpoint to delete a sale

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/sales/:id`);

- Only the sale with the `id` present in the URL must be deleted;

### 9 - Create an endpoint to update a sale

- The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/sales/:id`);

- The request body must receive the same structure used to create a sale;

- `quantity` must be an integer greater than 0;

- Only the sale with the `id` present in the URL must be updated;
